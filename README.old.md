# DIY-API-Client

Create a client for your DIY API Mongoose deliverable.

## Getting Started

* run `npx create-react-app .` to spin up a new react app
* get crackin!

## Steps to achieve

The best place ot start is by planning out the app you will be making. What routes are serving data that you can consume? What React features will you need to implement? What kind of user experience would you like to create?

### Begin by making wireframes and a component diagram

Keep in ming the user expirence while planning. User stories can help turn a user's experience into actionable items.

Plan out for your app:

* wireframes for every user view
* a component diagram that is informed by your wireframes and user experience
* the routes you will need on the front end

### Implement your design!

* Create the components you will need and the skeleton of the app
* After getting the scaffolding ready, implement your components one by one

### Keep in mind:

* you need your server running to deliver data to your react app
* you will ned to touch a `.env.local` and put your server's url in is as `REACT_APP_ < variable name >`
  * the format for your dev server's url should be `http://localhost: < the port express in running on >`
  * use `process.env.REACT_APP_ < variable name >` to access your server's url in your react app
* there is no right or wrong way to complete this assignment, have fun and experiment!
